# MVC-Pattern 
How MVC Architecture Parttern is implemented in java is shown in this code. <br /> 
<br /> 
MVC has basic 3 components: <br /> 
### Model: <br />
It updates view when new items are added. 
### View: <br />
View represents different views of a system. For example we have Watch Store it can 2 views i.e Products with normal prices and Products with sale prices. 
### Controller: <br /> 
Controller connects the Model and View of a system. It also notifies Model when to update.
